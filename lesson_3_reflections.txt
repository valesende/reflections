When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Creating a remote repository is useful when you want to share your project with collaborators or generally share it with a wider audience.
It also allows you to make changes to your files from a different computer than the one your repository was originally stored on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Changes may have been made by a collaborator that you don't want to have merged with your local files yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a similar function to clone, but is performed exclusively on GitHub. You would use Fork when you want to you part of someone's
repository but do not have permission to edit it. Clones are performed when you want to retrieve someone's repository and put it on your
own computer to edit. Branches are made locally and are used to make a seperate section of a repository in which someone else can edit, or 
you can make experiemental changes on your own.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So that you can edit it locally without having to be online.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Another way to collaborate without Git and GitHub would be a file sharing service like dropbox or google docs. However, these services
aren't made specifically for code and don't allow for many of the editing functions GitHub does, and don't have version control built in.
