What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository creates a staging area where you can add commits for your project.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows us to add one file at a time to a commit. It differs from the repository because the staging area is an intermediate between the working directory (where the files are added from) and the repository.



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
You can run git diff to compare the working directory to the staging area.
